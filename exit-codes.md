In Node.js, the exit code refers to a numeric code returned by a Node.js process when it terminates. This exit code can provide valuable information about the outcome of the process execution, helping developers and system administrators diagnose and troubleshoot issues. 
### Function of Exit Codes:

1. **Indicating Success or Failure**:
   - **Exit Code `0`**: Typically indicates successful termination of the Node.js process. It signifies that the program executed without any errors or issues.
   - **Non-Zero Exit Codes**: Any non-zero exit code (e.g., `1`, `2`, etc.) indicates that the process terminated abnormally or encountered an error during execution. The specific non-zero code often provides context or details about the nature of the error.

2. **Diagnosing Issues**:
   - Exit codes are essential for diagnosing and debugging Node.js applications and scripts. When a Node.js process exits with a non-zero code, it serves as an indicator that something went wrong during execution.
   - Developers can use exit codes to implement error handling strategies, log errors, or trigger specific actions based on the type of error encountered.

3. **Integration with Operating Systems**:
   - Node.js adheres to Unix conventions where an exit code of `0` signifies success, and non-zero codes indicate various types of failures or errors.
   - These exit codes can be leveraged by shell scripts, CI/CD pipelines, or other automation tools to determine the success or failure of Node.js processes and take appropriate actions.

### Examples of Using Exit Codes:

- **Explicit Exit with Code**:
  ```javascript
  // Example: Exiting Node.js process with a specific exit code
  process.exitCode = 1; // Setting a custom exit code
  process.exit(); // Exiting Node.js process with the set exit code
  ```

- **Handling Uncaught Exceptions**:
  ```javascript
  // Example: Handling uncaught exceptions and exiting with a non-zero code
  process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
      console.error('Uncaught Exception:', err);
      process.exit(1); // Exiting with code 1 (indicating failure)
  });
  ```

- **Exiting with Success**:
  ```javascript
  // Example: Exiting Node.js process with code 0 (success)
  process.exitCode = 0;
  process.exit(); // Exiting with code 0 (success)
  ```
