A Node Inspector typically refers to a debugging tool used for Node.js applications. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to debug Node.js applications, allowing developers to inspect variables, set breakpoints, step through code execution, and analyze runtime behavior. Node Inspector is commonly used during development to diagnose issues and understand the flow of execution within Node.js applications more effectively than using console.log statements alone.
