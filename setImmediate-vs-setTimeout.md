key differences in how and when they schedule the execution of the callback function:

1. **Timing of Execution**:
   - **`setImmediate()`**: This function schedules the callback to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop, immediately after I/O events and before any timers if scheduled using `setTimeout()` with a delay of 0 milliseconds. It is designed to execute as soon as possible, but it does not guarantee an exact time.
   
   - **`setTimeout()`**: This function schedules the callback to be executed after a specified delay (in milliseconds). The actual time when the callback is executed depends on the JavaScript runtime's workload and other factors. It is generally not guaranteed to be precise due to factors like system load and the JavaScript engine's internal workings.

2. **Order of Execution**:
   - If both `setImmediate()` and `setTimeout()` are called from within the same execution cycle, `setImmediate()` will always be executed before `setTimeout()` with a delay of 0 milliseconds.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - **`setImmediate()`**: Useful when you want to execute code asynchronously as soon as possible after the current operation completes, typically prioritizing non-blocking operations over I/O.
   
   - **`setTimeout()`**: Useful when you want to delay the execution of a callback function for a specific amount of time. It's commonly used for tasks like scheduling periodic operations, implementing delays, or simulating asynchronous behavior.

Hereâ€™s a basic example to illustrate the difference:

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setImmediate(() => {
    console.log('Immediate callback');
});

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('Timeout callback');
}, 0);

console.log('End');
```

### Output
```shell
Start
End
Timeout callback
Immediate callback
```

In this example:
- The output order will generally be `'Start'`, `'End'`, `'Immediate callback'`, `'Timeout callback'`.
- `setImmediate()` ensures that its callback is executed in the next iteration of the event loop after the current code finishes executing, even though it was called later in the code than `setTimeout()`.

In summary, `setImmediate()` prioritizes execution in the next event loop iteration, while `setTimeout()` schedules execution after a specified delay, but with no immediate guarantee of when exactly it will run.
