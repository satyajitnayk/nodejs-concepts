Server latency and scalability issues in Node.js can arise due to several factors, primarily related to its event-driven, single-threaded nature and how applications are architected and deployed. 

### 1. Blocking Operations

Node.js's single-threaded event loop is optimized for handling asynchronous I/O operations. However, performing synchronous or CPU-intensive tasks can block the event loop, causing delays in processing other incoming requests. Examples include:

- **Synchronous File Operations**: Using `fs.readFileSync` instead of `fs.readFile` can block the event loop while waiting for file I/O operations to complete.
  
- **CPU-Intensive Operations**: Performing heavy computations or complex algorithms synchronously within a Node.js process can lead to high CPU usage and impact the responsiveness of the server.

### 2. Long-Running Operations

Operations that take a significant amount of time to complete can increase server latency and reduce throughput. This includes:

- **Database Queries**: Queries that involve large datasets or complex joins can take time to execute, especially if the database server is under heavy load or located far from the application server.
  
- **API Calls**: Making synchronous API calls to external services or microservices that are slow to respond can introduce latency.

### 3. Inefficient Code and Architecture

Poorly optimized code or inefficient architectural decisions can hinder scalability and performance:

- **Memory Leaks**: Improper management of memory or resources can lead to memory leaks, impacting the stability and performance of the Node.js application over time.
  
- **Inefficient Algorithms**: Choosing inefficient algorithms or data structures can degrade performance, especially as the application scales up with increased traffic or data volume.

### 4. Lack of Horizontal Scaling

Node.js's single-threaded nature can limit its ability to fully utilize multi-core processors in a traditional deployment setup:

- **Scaling Vertically vs. Horizontally**: Scaling vertically (increasing server resources like CPU and RAM) may not be as effective as horizontal scaling (adding more instances of the application across multiple servers) for handling increased traffic or concurrent connections.
  
- **Load Balancing**: Proper load balancing across multiple Node.js instances or servers is essential for distributing incoming requests evenly and maximizing throughput.

### 5. Resource Contentions

Contentions for resources such as CPU, memory, and I/O bandwidth can impact server performance:

- **Shared Resources**: In multi-tenant environments or shared hosting setups, contention for resources among different applications or processes can lead to unpredictable latency spikes.
  
- **External Dependencies**: Dependencies on external services, databases, or APIs with varying response times can introduce latency and affect overall application performance.

### Mitigation Strategies:

To address these issues and improve server latency and scalability in Node.js applications, consider the following strategies:

- **Use Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize asynchronous I/O and non-blocking operations wherever possible to prevent blocking the event loop.
  
- **Optimize Database Queries**: Use indexing, query optimization techniques, and caching to reduce database query times.
  
- **Implement Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data or results to reduce the need for repeated computations or database accesses.

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy Node.js applications across multiple servers or containers and use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly.

- **Monitor and Tune Performance**: Continuously monitor application performance, analyze metrics (like response times and resource utilization), and optimize code and architecture based on performance benchmarks.
