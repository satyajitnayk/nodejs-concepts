There are four types of streams in Node.js: readable, writable, duplex, and transform.

**Readable**: The readable streams are used to read data from a specific source.

**Writable**: These streams are utilized for writing data to the destination.

**Duplex**: The duplex streams are used for both reading and writing data.

**Transform**: The transform stream enable the data to be transformed while it is being read or written. For example, you can use transform stream for data compression or data encryption as it is transmitted over the network.

### Detail 

In Node.js, there are four fundamental types of streams:

1. **Readable Streams**: These are streams from which data can be read. Examples include reading from a file (`fs.createReadStream()`), HTTP responses (`http.get()`), or data from a database query. Readable streams emit a `'data'` event when data is available to be consumed.

2. **Writable Streams**: These are streams to which data can be written. Examples include writing to a file (`fs.createWriteStream()`), sending an HTTP request (`http.request()`), or storing data into a database. Writable streams provide methods like `.write()` to send data and emit a `'finish'` event when all data has been written.

3. **Duplex Streams**: These streams are both readable and writable. They represent streams that can both receive data and send data back. An example is a TCP socket in Node.js (`net.Socket`), which allows both reading from and writing to the socket.

4. **Transform Streams**: These are a special type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on the input. They allow for data manipulation as it is being read or written. Examples include compression streams (`zlib.createGzip()`, `zlib.createGunzip()`), encryption streams (`crypto.createCipher()`, `crypto.createDecipher()`), or data conversion streams (`stream.Transform`).

These stream types allow Node.js applications to efficiently handle data, especially when dealing with large amounts of data that can be processed in chunks instead of all at once, thus improving memory usage and performance.
