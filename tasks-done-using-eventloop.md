Tasks that can be effectively handled asynchronously with the help of an event loop in Node.js include:

1. **File System Operations**:
   - Reading from and writing to files (`fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile`).
   - Watching for changes in files or directories (`fs.watch`).

2. **Network Operations**:
   - Making HTTP/HTTPS requests (`http.request`, `https.request`).
   - Creating TCP/UDP servers and clients (`net.createServer`, `net.createConnection`).

3. **Database Queries**:
   - Executing queries to relational databases (using database drivers like `mysql`, `pg`, `mongodb`).
   - Connecting to and querying NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB).

4. **Timers and Delays**:
   - Setting timeouts (`setTimeout`) and intervals (`setInterval`).
   - Using `setImmediate` to execute code on the next iteration of the event loop.

5. **Event Handling**:
   - Listening for events from user interactions in web applications (e.g., clicks, keystrokes).
   - Handling events from external sources such as IoT devices or message queues.

6. **Child Processes**:
   - Spawning child processes (`child_process.spawn`) for executing external commands or scripts.
   - Communicating with child processes asynchronously (`stdout`, `stderr` streams).

7. **Streams**:
   - Working with readable streams (`fs.createReadStream`, `http.ServerResponse`).
   - Writing to writable streams (`fs.createWriteStream`, `http.ClientRequest`).

8. **Concurrency Management**:
   - Managing multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the main event loop.
   - Utilizing worker threads (`worker_threads` module) for CPU-bound tasks in Node.js versions that support it.

9. **Middleware and Request Handling**:
   - Handling middleware in web frameworks like Express.js, where each middleware function can execute asynchronously and pass control to the next function in the stack.

10. **Real-Time Communication**:
    - Implementing real-time applications using WebSockets (`ws` library, `socket.io`) for bidirectional communication between clients and servers.

Node.js's event-driven architecture and asynchronous I/O model enable these tasks to be performed efficiently without blocking the main thread. This approach enhances the responsiveness and scalability of Node.js applications, making it suitable for handling concurrent operations in web servers, microservices, real-time applications, and more.
