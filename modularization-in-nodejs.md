Modularization in Node.js refers to breaking down your codebase into smaller, reusable modules. This approach offers several benefits, such as improved maintainability, reusability of code, and better organization of functionality. 
### When to Use Modularization in Node.js:

1. **Code Reusability**: Modules allow you to encapsulate functionality that can be reused across different parts of your application or even in different applications.

2. **Maintainability**: Breaking down your codebase into smaller modules makes it easier to manage and maintain. Each module can focus on a specific aspect of functionality, making it easier to debug and update.

3. **Scalability**: Modularization facilitates scalability by allowing you to add or modify functionality without affecting other parts of the application, promoting separation of concerns.

4. **Team Collaboration**: When working in teams, modularization promotes better collaboration. Team members can work on different modules independently, reducing conflicts and improving productivity.
