| **Definition**          | Involves temporarily storing data in memory (buffers) before processing or transmitting it. | Involves processing data piece by piece as it becomes available, without buffering the entire dataset. |
| **Data Handling**       | Entire data set is read into memory buffers before processing. | Data is processed incrementally in small, manageable chunks (streams). |
| **Memory Usage**        | May consume more memory, especially for large datasets.      | Conservatively uses memory by processing data in chunks.      |
| **I/O Operations**      | Typically used in synchronous I/O operations.                | Primarily used in asynchronous I/O operations.               |
| **Processing Efficiency**| Efficient for small datasets or when entire dataset is needed upfront. | Efficient for large datasets or continuous data streams.     |
| **Examples**            | Reading a file using `fs.readFile` or `fs.readFileSync`, where the entire file contents are loaded into memory. | Using `fs.createReadStream` to process large files without loading them entirely into memory. |
| **Event Handling**      | Works with events like 'data', 'end', and 'error' during file or data processing. | Works with events like 'data', 'end', and 'error' in streams for handling data as it arrives or is processed. |

### Example for Buffering:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Buffering example: Reading a file using fs.readFile
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error reading file:', err);
    } else {
        console.log('File contents:', data);
    }
});
```

In this example, `fs.readFile` buffers the entire contents of `example.txt` into memory before invoking the callback function with the complete data.

### Example for Streaming:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Streaming example: Reading a file using fs.createReadStream
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('example.txt', 'utf8');

readStream.on('data', chunk => {
    console.log('Received chunk of data:', chunk);
});

readStream.on('end', () => {
    console.log('Finished reading file.');
});

readStream.on('error', err => {
    console.error('Error reading file:', err);
});
```

Here, `fs.createReadStream` creates a readable stream for `example.txt`, processing the file data in manageable chunks (`chunk`) as they become available, without buffering the entire file into memory at once.

### Summary:

- **Buffering** involves loading entire data into memory before processing, suitable for smaller datasets or synchronous operations.
- **Streaming** processes data incrementally in manageable chunks, conserving memory and supporting efficient handling of large datasets or continuous streams in asynchronous operations.
