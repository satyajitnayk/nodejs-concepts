- Yes, duplex streams in Node.js are streams that are both readable and writable. 
- This means you can both write data to them and read data from them simultaneously. 
- Duplex streams are useful in scenarios where data needs to be processed bidirectionally, such as in network communication or file processing.

Here's an example of creating and using a duplex stream in Node.js:

```javascript
const { Duplex } = require('stream');

// Custom duplex stream implementation
class MyDuplexStream extends Duplex {
    constructor(options) {
        super(options);
        this.data = ['One', 'Two', 'Three', 'Four', 'Five'];
        this.currentIdx = 0;
    }

    _read(size) {
        // Simulate reading data from a source (in this case, an array)
        if (this.currentIdx < this.data.length) {
            this.push(this.data[this.currentIdx]);
            this.currentIdx++;
        } else {
            this.push(null); // No more data to push
        }
    }

    _write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
        // Simulate processing or handling incoming data
        console.log('Received data:', chunk.toString());
        callback();
    }
}

// Usage of the custom duplex stream
const myDuplexStream = new MyDuplexStream();

// Read from the duplex stream
myDuplexStream.on('data', chunk => {
    console.log('Received from duplex:', chunk.toString());
});

// Write to the duplex stream
myDuplexStream.write('Data to write\n');

// End the stream
myDuplexStream.end();
```

### Output

```shell
Received data: Data to write

Received from duplex: One
Received from duplex: Two
Received from duplex: Three
Received from duplex: Four
Received from duplex: Five
```
