Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side scripts, enabling them to build scalable and efficient network applications.

> Remember: Node.js is not good with CPU-intensive applications.

### Core Components of Node.js:

1. **V8 JavaScript Engine**:
   - **Description**: V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google. It compiles JavaScript code into native machine code, optimizing its execution speed. In Node.js, V8 is embedded to execute JavaScript server-side.
   - **Usage**: V8 ensures Node.js applications run efficiently by compiling JavaScript code directly into machine code. It employs various optimization techniques like JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation to enhance performance, making Node.js suitable for high-performance applications.

2. **libuv**:
   - **Description**: libuv is a multi-platform library that provides asynchronous I/O operations, networking functionalities, and concurrency for Node.js. It abstracts operating system differences and provides a consistent API for asynchronous event handling.
   - **Usage**: libuv enables Node.js to achieve non-blocking, event-driven I/O operations. It manages tasks such as file system operations, network requests, and timers efficiently, utilizing features like event loops and thread pools to handle concurrent tasks without blocking the application's main thread.

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - **Description**: Node.js operates on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. It uses events to handle asynchronous operations and callbacks to notify when operations complete or data is available.
   - **Usage**: This architecture allows Node.js to handle multiple requests concurrently without creating threads for each request, making it highly scalable and efficient for handling I/O-intensive applications such as web servers, real-time applications, and microservices.
