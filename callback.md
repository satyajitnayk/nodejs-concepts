In Node.js, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called back at a later point in time. The purpose of using a callback function is to handle asynchronous operations.

In asynchronous programming, a function that initiates an asynchronous operation returns immediately while the operation continues in the background. When the operation is completed, the callback function is called with the result of the operation.


**Example**:
   ```javascript
   // Example of a function with a callback
   function readFileAndProcess(filePath, callback) {
       fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
           if (err) {
               callback(err); // Pass the error to the callback
               return;
           }
           callback(null, data); // Pass data to the callback
       });
   }

   // Usage of the function with a callback
   readFileAndProcess('/path/to/file.txt', (err, data) => {
       if (err) {
           console.error('Error reading file:', err);
           return;
       }
       console.log('File content:', data);
   });
   ```

   - In this example, `readFileAndProcess()` is a function that reads a file asynchronously using `fs.readFile()`.
   - It accepts a `filePath` and a `callback` function.
   - Inside `readFileAndProcess()`, `fs.readFile()` is used to read the file content asynchronously.
   - When `fs.readFile()` completes, it calls the provided callback function with an error (if any) and the data read from the file.
   - In the callback passed to `readFileAndProcess()`, we handle errors and process the data read from the file.

Callbacks are crucial in Node.js because they allow you to manage asynchronous operations efficiently without blocking the event loop. They enable functions to be executed once certain operations complete, facilitating responsive and scalable applications.
